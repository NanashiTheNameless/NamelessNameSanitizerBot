# Terms of Service

Last updated: 2025-11-01

These Terms govern your use of NamelessNameSanitizerBot ("the Bot"). By adding or using the Bot in your Discord server, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Service Description

The Bot helps enforce nickname policies in Discord servers, offering per-guild configuration, administrative controls, and optional logging.
The Bot may also optionally notify the bot owner of guild join/leave events via direct messages when enabled by the operator.

## 2. Access and Eligibility

- You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
- You must have permission from your server to add and configure bots.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Bot in violation of any law or regulation.
- Use the Bot to harass, discriminate, or otherwise harm individuals or communities.
- Attempt to disrupt, reverse engineer, or exploit the Bot.
- Bypass or misuse Discord’s API, rate limits, or policies. You must comply with Discord Developer Terms and Policies at all times.

## 4. Permissions and Data

- The Bot requires certain permissions (e.g., Manage Nicknames) to function correctly.
- The Bot processes and stores minimal configuration data as described in the Privacy Policy.
- The Bot does not read or store message content.
- The Bot may log certain operational events (e.g., nickname changes in a configured logging channel, guild join/leave notifications to the bot owner if enabled) as described in the Privacy Policy.
- You must not store or export Bot data for purposes unrelated to moderation without appropriate notice and legal basis.
- You must inform server members that nickname changes may be enforced by automation (e.g., via server rules or announcements).

## 5. Availability and Updates

- The Bot is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Uptime is not guaranteed.
- Features may change, be added, or be removed at any time.
- Blacklisted guilds: The bot owner may add a guild to a blacklist; the bot will automatically leave such guilds on startup or upon joining, and delete stored per-guild settings/admins for those guilds.
- Command cooldown: The operator may enable a short per-user cooldown on commands to prevent accidental repeated actions. Owners and bot admins are exempt.
- We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use indicates acceptance.
- Material changes will be reflected by the "Last updated" date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Bot maintainers and contributors are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, arising from your use of the Bot.

## 7. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the maintainers and contributors from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising from your use of the Bot or violation of these Terms.

## 8. Termination

- Server administrators can remove the Bot at any time.
- We may suspend or terminate the Bot’s operation or your access at our discretion if we believe misuse or harm is occurring.

## 9. Open Source and Licensing

- The Bot is open source and licensed as noted in `license.md`.
- Contributions are welcome subject to the repository’s contributing guidelines and license.

## 10. Contact

For questions about these Terms, open an issue on the repository or contact the server owner/operator.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the operator’s jurisdiction unless otherwise required by applicable law.
