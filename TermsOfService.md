# Terms of Service

Last updated: 2025-11-06 (YYYY-MM-DD)

By adding or using NamelessNameSanitizerBot ("the Bot") in your Discord server, you agree to these terms.

## What the Bot does

Enforces nickname rules with per‑guild settings and optional logging. It can optionally DM the bot owner about guild join/leave events.

## Using the Bot

- Follow Discord’s Terms and Community Guidelines.
- Follow the bot's terms and license.
- Only add/configure the Bot if you have permission to do so.

## Acceptable use

Do not use the Bot to break laws, harass people, evade Discord policies, attack/abuse the service, attempt to reverse engineer and/or disrupt the bot.

## Permissions & data

- Needs relevant Discord permissions (e.g., Manage Nicknames) to work.
- Stores minimal per‑guild configuration and operational data. No message content is stored.
- May log nickname changes to a configured channel and guild join/leave events (if enabled). Owner‑only commands may DM summaries of guild settings.
- Tell members that automated nickname changes may occur.

### Anonymous telemetry (opt‑out)

To estimate adoption, the Bot sends a tiny census event once on startup and every 2 hours (UTC). Please see the Privacy Policy for more info.

## Changes & availability

- Provided "as is" without uptime guarantees.
- Features and terms may change; the “Last updated” date will reflect updates. Continued use means acceptance.
- Blacklisted guilds: The bot owner may blacklist any guild(s) for any reason; the Bot leaves and deletes that guild’s stored settings/admins.
- Command cooldown: operator may enable a short per‑user cooldown (owners and bot admins exempt).

## Policy Consistency for Forks / Self-Hosted Instances

Any public fork, re‑deployment, or self‑hosted instance of the Bot that interacts with third parties MUST adopt verbatim (word‑for‑word) the official Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and License provided with this software, except for purely cosmetic formatting adjustments (for example, heading styles or link formatting) and substitution of the operational contact method. Substantive changes, omissions, or additions are prohibited unless separately and conspicuously approved in writing by the original maintainers. If you cannot or will not comply, do not expose the Bot (or any derivative) for third‑party use.

## Liability

To the fullest extent allowed by law we are not liable for indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive damages, lost profits, or lost data arising from using the Bot.

## Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold maintainers/contributors harmless from claims arising out of your misuse or violation of these terms.

## Ending use

Admins can remove the Bot any time. We may suspend or terminate access if misuse or harm occurs.

## Open-Source

Licensed as described in [license.md](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/NamelessNameSanitizerBot/blob/main/license.md>). Contributions welcome under the repository’s guidelines.

## Contact

Open a GitHub issue or contact the bot owner/operator.

## Governing law

These terms follow the laws of the operator’s jurisdiction unless a different law applies.
